Sleep Health: Quantity vs Quality
Research Question

Does a higher quantity of sleep necessarily correspond to a higher quality of sleep?

# Overview

This project explores how sleep duration and sleep quality relate to student wellness, including academic performance, learning and retention, mental health, and daytime functioning. It synthesizes background findings from sleep science to evaluate whether “more sleep” reliably translates to “better sleep.”
